  # Module Auth provides classes that provide Google-specific authorization

    # DefaultCredentials is used to preload the credentials file, to determine

    class DefaultCredentials

      ##
      # Override CredentialsLoader#make_creds to use the class determined by
      # loading the json.
      #
      # **Important:** If you accept a credential configuration (credential
      # JSON/File/Stream) from an external source for authentication to Google
      # Cloud, you must validate it before providing it to any Google API or
      # library. Providing an unvalidated credential configuration to Google
      # APIs can compromise the security of your systems and data. For more
      # information, refer to [Validate credential configurations from external
      # sources](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials).
      #
      # @deprecated This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
      #   Please use the `make_creds` method on the specific credential class you intend to load,
      #   e.g., `Google::Auth::ServiceAccountCredentials.make_creds`.
      #
      #   This method does not validate the credential configuration. The security
      #   risk occurs when a credential configuration is accepted from a source that
      #   is not under your control and used without validation on your side.
      #
      #   If you know that you will be loading credential configurations of a
      #   specific type, it is recommended to use a credential-type-specific
      #   `make_creds` method.
      #   This will ensure that an unexpected credential type with potential for
      #   malicious intent is not loaded unintentionally. You might still have to do
      #   validation for certain credential types. Please follow the recommendation
      #   for that method. For example, if you want to load only service accounts,
      #   you can use:
      #   ```
      #   creds = Google::Auth::ServiceAccountCredentials.make_creds
      #   ```
      #   @see Google::Auth::ServiceAccountCredentials.make_creds
      #
      #   If you are loading your credential configuration from an untrusted source and have
      #   not mitigated the risks (e.g. by validating the configuration yourself), make
      #   these changes as soon as possible to prevent security risks to your environment.
      #
      #   Regardless of the method used, it is always your responsibility to validate
      #   configurations received from external sources.
      #
      #   See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials for more details.
